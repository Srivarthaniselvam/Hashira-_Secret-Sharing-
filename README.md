## Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm 

Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications through the use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and suffix graphy means “writing”. In this article, a type of cryptographic technique, Shamir's secret sharing algorithm is discussed.
